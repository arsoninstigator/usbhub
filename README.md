# usb hub pcb
i made a usb hub by kind of referencing the [jam by max wofford](https://jams.hackclub.com/batch/usb-hub) to build a type-c usb hub with two type-a ports. next, i was bored and then tinkered around with the pcb to add two additional type-a ports for increased productivity since i have a LOT of wired gear around so the more ports the better (granted they're all usb c in my country but my point still stands).

here's the 3d view of what our pcb would look like after it's assembled -

i also tried to make a type-c usb hub but that is still in the works and currently not working as intended
